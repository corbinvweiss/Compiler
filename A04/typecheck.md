# Type Checking

See the assignment [here](https://www.cs.southern.edu/halterman/Courses/Winter2025/415/Assignments/typecheck.html).

Add type information to each node of the AST.

Each class is responsible for checking that the type of the expression it is being assigned to is compatible with the type that it is.
